   You may have a possible risk of getting pre-diabetes, therefore it is best to change your lifestyle. If you're overweight, your prediabetes will most likely turn into diabetes - dropping even as little as 5 - 10% of body weight makes a vast difference. Achieve this by consuming low-fat proteins and vegetables, and limiting calories, sugars and starchy carbs. Quitting smoking, drinking alcohol only moderately (if you drink already), and reducing stress all help keep your blood glucose levels under control. Speak to your GP about joining a Type 2 diabetes prevention program.
